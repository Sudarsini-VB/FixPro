# FixPro – AI-Powered Issue Reporting System

## 📌 Problem Statement

In colleges, hostels, and campuses, students face daily infrastructure issues such as:
- Broken taps 🚰
- Electrical faults 💡
- Internet problems 🌐
- Damaged furniture 🪑
- Cleanliness and maintenance issues 🧹

Currently, reporting these problems is:
- Manual and slow
- Unstructured (calls, WhatsApp messages, verbal complaints)
- Difficult to track
- Lacking prioritization
- Frustrating for both students and administrators

As a result, critical issues are delayed, minor issues are ignored, and there is no transparency in the resolution process.
